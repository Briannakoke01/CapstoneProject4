I will be focusing primarily on the front-end UI, which makes sense for a meme-generation app since the main interaction will be selecting images, adding text, and previewing the final meme. I believe I would like to create an app for convenience but with using front end UI a website might be best. The goal of my project is to enhance the existing meme-generation app by streamlining the API functionality. I plan to eliminate the requirement for users to manually input a photo link. Instead, Iâ€™ll implement a more intuitive image selection process, allowing users to choose from a gallery of predefined images directly within the app. This update aims to improve user experience by simplifying image selection and making meme creation faster and more user-friendly. This will be designed for a broad demographic, ranging from casual social media users to meme enthusiasts who enjoy creating and sharing content. Users of all ages and backgrounds, including those looking for a quick, fun, and user-friendly way to create custom memes, will be able to generate, customize, and share meme content easily. For this meme-generation app or website, I plan to use an image-based dataset featuring a variety of popular images often used in memes, along with related metadata like image tags, categories, and descriptions. This dataset will make it easier for users to browse or search for specific images without needing to input a link manually.
To gather this data, I may use an existing API focused on trending images and memes if a suitable one is available, or I'll create a custom API to store and manage the image collection directly. This custom API will allow me to tailor the data structure for the specific needs of the app, ensuring easy retrieval and smooth integration with the front end.
